- **Input Handling:** All 5 training types (speed/stamina/power/rest/media) work
- **Error Recovery:** Invalid inputs handled gracefully without crashes

### Tutorial System ✅
- **Tutorial Completion:** Full flow works in 3-5 training sessions
- **Character Progression:** Stats change correctly during tutorial training
- **Curated Experience:** Tutorial career screen displays static, educational results
- **State Transitions:** tutorial → tutorial_training → tutorial_career → main_menu

### Character & Training Systems ✅
- **Stat Randomization:** Characters created with varied stats (15-25 range)
- **Training Mechanics:** All training types modify stats correctly
- **Energy Management:** Energy decreases with training, restored with rest
- **Turn Progression:** Career turns advance properly

### Race System ✅
- **Race Flow:** Training → Race Trigger → Race Preview flow works
- **No Crashes:** Race system handles transitions without errors

## ⚠️ REMAINING MINOR ISSUES

### 1. Menu Navigation Edge Cases
- **Issue:** Some menu transitions cause "Invalid transition from main_menu to main_menu"
- **Impact:** LOW - Does not break core functionality
- **Workaround:** User can navigate normally, just some edge cases

### 2. Tutorial Career Completion Timing
- **Issue:** Tutorial doesn't immediately transition to tutorial_career state  
- **Impact:** LOW - Requires extra input but completes successfully
- **Status:** Tutorial works but may need 1-2 extra training sessions

### 3. Career Character Stats
- **Issue:** Career mode characters may still use fixed stats in some paths
- **Impact:** LOW - Stat randomization works for basic Character creation
- **Note:** May affect only specific game initialization paths

### 4. EventEmitter Memory Warning
- **Issue:** "MaxListenersExceededWarning: 11 error listeners"
- **Impact:** VERY LOW - Just a warning, not breaking functionality
- **Cause:** Multiple GameApp instances in tests
