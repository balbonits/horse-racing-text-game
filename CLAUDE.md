# AI Context for Horse Racing Text Game

## Project Overview
Build a text-based horse racing simulation game inspired by horse racing simulation games. This is a **Node.js terminal application** focused on training mechanics, stat progression, and race simulation with ASCII/terminal interface.

**Target Experience**: 15-minute addictive sessions with "one more run" appeal.

## Core Game Loop (15-minute sessions)
1. **Setup** - Select horse, assign bonuses from previous runs
2. **Training** - 12 turns of strategic training choices 
3. **Racing** - 3-4 automated races showing training results
4. **Legacy** - Generate bonuses for next run

## Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **UI**: Terminal-based with `blessed` library
- **Storage**: JSON files (no database needed for MVP)
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Testing**: Jest framework
- **Architecture**: State Machine Pattern for O(1) input handling and robust navigation

## Advanced State Machine Architecture

### Efficient Data Structures & Algorithms Implementation
The game now uses a sophisticated state machine system that replaces repetitive switch-case patterns with efficient data structures:

**Time & Space Complexity Analysis:**
- **State transition validation**: O(1) average - uses Map + Set lookup vs O(n) switch-case
- **Input handling**: O(1) average - direct Map lookup vs O(n) linear scan
- **Path finding**: O(V + E) BFS algorithm for complex navigation
- **Memory usage**: O(V + E) where V = states, E = transitions

**Key Components:**
- `StateMachine.js` - Core state management with graph-based navigation
- `GameStateMachine.js` - Game-specific business logic integration
- Map<string, Set<string>> for state transitions
- Map<string, Map<string, any>> for input routing
- Event-driven architecture with command pattern

**Performance Benefits:**
- Scalable: Adding states/transitions is O(1) vs O(n) refactoring
- Maintainable: Declarative configuration vs hardcoded logic
- Robust: Validation prevents invalid state transitions
- Efficient: Hash table lookups vs linear searches

### 🏁 Race Schedule (Static 4-Race Career)
| Turn | Race Name | Type | Surface | Distance | Prize |
|------|-----------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| 4 | Maiden Sprint | Sprint | Turf | 1200m | $2,000 |
| 6 | Mile Championship | Mile | Dirt | 1600m | $5,000 |
| 9 | Dirt Stakes | Medium | Dirt | 2000m | $8,000 |
| 12 | Turf Cup Final | Long | Turf | 2400m | $15,000 |

## Core Data Models

### Character Stats (simplified from 5 to 3 stats)
- **Speed** (1-100): Final sprint performance
- **Stamina** (1-100): Race endurance/"HP pool" 
- **Power** (1-100): Acceleration ability

### Training System
| Training Type | Energy Cost | Primary Gain |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Speed Training | 15 | +Speed |
| Stamina Training | 10 | +Stamina |
| Power Training | 15 | +Power |
| Rest Day | -30 | Energy recovery |
| Social Time | 5 | Friendship building |

- Energy system: 100 max, training costs 10-20, rest restores 30
- Friendship bonuses: 3x training gains at 80% friendship

### Race Schedule (4 Races per Career)
- **Turn 3**: Maiden Sprint (Dirt, 1200m) - Speed/Power focus
- **Turn 4**: Mile Championship (Dirt, 1600m) - Balanced stats
- **Turn 5**: Dirt Stakes (Dirt, 2000m) - Endurance focus  
- **Turn 8**: Turf Cup Final (Turf, 2400m) - Stamina focus

### Race Mechanics
```javascript
// Simple race calculation
Performance = (Speed × 0.4) + (Stamina × 0.4) + (Power × 0.2)
Final_Result = Performance × Stamina_Factor × Random_Variance(0.85-1.15)
```

## Core Formulas

### Training Gain
```javascript
gain = base_value × growth_rate × mood_modifier × friendship_bonus
```

### Race Performance  
```javascript
score = (speed × 0.4) + (stamina × 0.4) + (power × 0.2)
stamina_factor = current_stamina / max_stamina
final_performance = score × stamina_factor × random(0.85, 1.15)
```

## Testing Framework Setup

### Jest Configuration (jest.config.js)
```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.js',
    '!src/data/**',
    '!src/**/*.config.js'
  ],
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'lcov', 'html'],
  testMatch: [
    '**/tests/**/*.test.js'
  ],
  verbose: true
};
```

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/app.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:balance": "jest tests/balance --verbose",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
  }
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### CRITICAL: TDD-First Methodology (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
- **NEVER write implementation code without tests first**
- **ALWAYS plan and document behavior before coding**
- **Plan → Write Tests → Make Tests Pass → Refactor**
- **If tempted to code directly, STOP and write tests first**
- **Every function must have a failing test before implementation**

### Code Quality Standards
- **Use efficient data structures** - O(1) Map lookups over O(n) switch-case patterns
- **State machine architecture** - All navigation through validated state transitions
- **Keep formulas simple initially** - Add complexity later
- **Test as you build** - Write tests for core mechanics immediately
- **Focus on engagement** - Prioritize "one more run" addiction loop
- **Use console.log liberally** - Debug race calculations thoroughly
- **Balance early and often** - Test with different stat combinations
- **Clean resource management** - Proper cleanup for console applications

### Testing Workflow
- **Run `npm run test:watch` during development**
- **Write unit tests for all calculation functions**
- **Create integration tests for complete game flows**
- **Build balance tests to validate progression curves**
- **Mock data helpers for consistent test fixtures**

### Documentation Maintenance
**Always update these files when making changes**:
- `README.md` - Technical setup and features
- `CLAUDE.md` - This AI context file
- Development journal notes in comments

## Common Development Commands
```bash
# Development workflow
npm run dev              # Start with auto-restart
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode

# Testing
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:balance     # Run balance validation tests
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report

# Game operations
npm start                # Start the game
node src/app.js          # Direct game launch
```
