# UX Flow & Racing Mechanics Guide

## Complete Game Flow Overview

### 1. Application States & Transitions

The game uses 7 distinct states with clean transitions:

```
main_menu ‚Üí character_creation ‚Üí training ‚Üí race_results ‚Üí [career_complete OR training]
    ‚Üë           ‚Üì                    ‚Üë         ‚Üì               ‚Üì
help ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ load_game              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (auto-cycles) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

#### State Details:

| State | Purpose | User Actions | Next State |
|-------|---------|--------------|------------|
| **main_menu** | Game start/hub | 1-4 keys, Q | character_creation, load_game, help |
| **character_creation** | Horse naming | Type name + Enter | training |
| **training** | Core gameplay | 1-5 training, S save, Q quit | race_results (auto on turns 4,8,12) |
| **race_results** | Race outcomes | Any key to continue | training or career_complete |
| **load_game** | Save selection | 1-N load slot, Q back | training |
| **help** | Instructions | Any key | training |
| **career_complete** | End summary | Enter for new career | character_creation |

## 2. Complete Racing Mechanics

### Race Schedule (Immutable)
- **Turn 4**: Debut Sprint (1200m) - Speed/Power focused
- **Turn 8**: Mile Challenge (1600m) - Balanced stats  
- **Turn 12**: Championship (2000m) - Stamina/Endurance focused

### Race Trigger System
```
Training Turn Complete ‚Üí Check Race Schedule ‚Üí Auto-Trigger Race ‚Üí Show Results ‚Üí Continue
```

**Key Points:**
- Races are **mandatory** and **automatic** on scheduled turns
- No user choice to skip or delay races
- Race performance directly reflects training decisions
- UI shows prominent warnings: "*** RACE HAPPENS AFTER THIS TRAINING! ***"

### Performance Calculation Algorithm

```javascript
// Step 1: Base Performance Calculation
base_performance = (speed √ó 0.4) + (stamina √ó 0.4) + (power √ó 0.2)

// Step 2: Apply Energy Factor  
energy_factor = current_energy / max_energy

// Step 3: Apply Distance Modifiers
if (race_distance === 1200) {  // Sprint
  distance_modifier = 1.0 + (speed_advantage * 0.15)
} else if (race_distance === 1600) {  // Mile
  distance_modifier = 1.0  // Balanced
} else if (race_distance === 2000) {  // Long
  distance_modifier = 1.0 + (stamina_advantage * 0.2)
}

// Step 4: Apply Randomness (¬±15%)
random_variance = random(0.85, 1.15)

// Step 5: Final Score
final_performance = base_performance √ó energy_factor √ó distance_modifier √ó random_variance
```

### Race Competition
- **Participants**: You + 7 AI horses (8 total)
- **AI Stats**: Randomized 30-70 range for realistic competition
- **Ranking**: 1st-8th place based on final_performance scores
- **Results**: Position, time, performance score, commentary

### Strategy Guide

| Race Type | Optimal Training | Why |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| **Sprint (1200m)** | Speed 60+, Power 50+ | Quick acceleration and top speed crucial |
| **Mile (1600m)** | Balanced 40+ all stats | Requires well-rounded performance |
| **Championship (2000m)** | Stamina 60+, moderate others | Endurance is key for long distance |

## 3. Core User Journeys

### First-Time Player (Target: 5 minutes to "get it")

```
1. Launch Game ‚Üí See main menu (familiar interface)
2. Press "1" ‚Üí Character creation (simple name input)
3. Type horse name ‚Üí Training screen appears (clear stats display)
4. Press "1" (Speed Training) ‚Üí See immediate stat increase +visual feedback
5. Continue 2-3 training actions ‚Üí Energy decreases visibly
6. Turn 4 approaches ‚Üí See prominent "RACE AFTER TRAINING!" warning
7. Complete training ‚Üí Auto-race triggers with clear transition
8. See race results ‚Üí Understand position reflects training choices
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Player understands stat ‚Üí training ‚Üí performance connection within 3 minutes
- No confusion about what numbers mean or actions do
- Race results feel like natural consequence of training decisions

### Core Gameplay Loop (Target: 15-minute sessions)

```
Training Phase (12 turns):
  Turn 1-3: Build foundation stats
  Turn 4: RACE 1 (Debut Sprint) ‚Üí Immediate feedback
  Turn 5-7: Adjust strategy based on race results  
  Turn 8: RACE 2 (Mile Challenge) ‚Üí Mid-career assessment
  Turn 9-11: Final preparation for championship
  Turn 12: RACE 3 (Championship) ‚Üí Career climax

Results & Legacy:
  Career grade calculation ‚Üí Legacy bonuses ‚Üí "One more run" appeal
```

**Engagement Factors:**
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Every training choice shows instant stat changes
2. **Strategic Depth**: Race schedule creates planning opportunities
3. **Risk/Reward**: Energy management adds tactical decisions
4. **Progression**: Each race validates/challenges strategy
5. **Replayability**: Legacy system + random variance encourage multiple runs

### Power User Journey (Target: Multiple sessions)

```
Session 1: Learn mechanics, complete first career
Session 2: Apply lessons, optimize strategy  
Session 3: Save/load, experiment with different builds
Session 4+: Legacy bonus stacking, perfect run attempts
```

## 4. UX Principles & Design Decisions

### Clarity & Feedback
- **Every action has immediate visual feedback** (stat changes, energy bars)
- **Clear state transitions** with headers and visual separators
- **Prominent warnings** for important events (races, energy depletion)
- **Consistent language** across all UI elements

### Simplicity & Focus  
- **Minimal input complexity** (single key presses, simple text input)
- **Clean information hierarchy** (most important info at top)
- **No overwhelming choices** (max 5 options at any time)
- **Progressive disclosure** (advanced features emerge naturally)

### Engagement & Flow
- **Rapid feedback loops** (training ‚Üí stats ‚Üí race ‚Üí results)
- **Clear goal progression** (turn counter, race schedule)
- **Natural stopping points** (after races, career completion)
- **"One more run" hooks** (legacy bonuses, strategy refinement)

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management
- Single `currentState` variable drives all UI rendering
- State transitions are atomic and always render new screen
- No complex state hierarchies or nested modes

### Input Handling
- Readline-based for maximum terminal compatibility  
- Single-character commands for speed (1-5, Q, S, etc.)
- Text input only for character names
- All inputs immediately processed and acknowledged

### Performance Characteristics
- Race calculations complete in <100ms
- State transitions render in <50ms  
- No memory leaks in training/race loops
- Clean screen clearing prevents terminal artifacts
