## Test Coverage Summary

### Areas Well Covered ‚úÖ
- Character stats and progression
- NPH roster generation
- Basic race calculations
- UI rendering
- Input handling
- State transitions

### Areas Needing More Tests ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Race result persistence
- Character updates after races
- Save/Load with race data
- Career completion flow
- Memory/performance under long sessions

### Known Failing Tests üî¥
- Tests expecting "enhanced" race system behavior
- Tests for race stats persistence (the bug we're fixing)
- Some integration tests due to state machine changes

---

## Test Execution Commands

## Test Maintenance Notes

### Tests to Update/Remove
1. **enhanced-race-system.test.js** - Remove after consolidating to single race system
2. **race-preview-bug.test.js** - Can be removed once bug is fixed
3. Tests expecting two race systems need updating

### Tests to Add
1. Race completion updates character stats correctly
2. Race results persist across state transitions
3. Complete 4-race career progression (turns 3, 4, 5, 8)
4. Race schedule generation and tracking
5. Long distance race mechanics (LONG type races)
6. All 4 race types: SPRINT, MILE, MEDIUM, LONG
